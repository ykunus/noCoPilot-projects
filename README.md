# NoCoPilot ðŸš€

## About This Repository

In an effort to **reduce my dependency on AI tools like Copilot**, I am challenging myself to complete **one project per week** without using any AI assistance. 

The goal is to **increase the difficulty of the projects** over time, forcing myself to rely on my own problem-solving skills, debugging, and documentation. This repository will serve as a **journal of my progress**, showcasing each project as I build it from scratch.

## Challenge Rules
- **No AI assistance** (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) during coding.
- **One project per week**, each with an increasing level of difficulty.
- **Document each project** with a brief description and learnings.
- **Use official documentation, books, and human mentorship** when necessary.

## Project Structure
Each project will be in its own folder, following this format:


## Why This Challenge?
While AI tools can be incredibly useful, over-reliance on them can limit **true problem-solving skills and deep learning**. This challenge is a way to **sharpen my own abilities**, build confidence, and become a more self-sufficient developer.

## Follow My Journey
Check back weekly to see my latest projects and progress! If you're interested in doing a similar challenge, feel free to fork this repository and start your own **NoCoPilot** journey.

ðŸ“Œ *This repository is a personal challenge and learning experiment, not a rejection of AI, but a way to ensure I stay sharp as a programmer.*
